Architecture of Terraform
Terraform architecture mainly consists of the following components:

>Providers
>State file
#In image you can see the Architecture of the terrform.
1. Terraform Core
Terraform’s core (also known as Terraform CLI) is built on a statically-compiled binary that’s developed using the Go programming language.


Providers
Terraform providers are modules that enable Terraform to communicate with a diverse range of services and resources, including but not limited to cloud providers, databases, and DNS services. 

Each provider is responsible for defining the resources that Terraform can manage within a particular service and translating Terraform configurations into API calls that are specific to that service.

Providers are available for numerous services and resources, including those developed by major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as community-supported providers for various services. By utilizing providers, Terraform users can maintain their infrastructure in a consistent and reproducible manner, regardless of the underlying service or provider. 

State file
The Terraform state file is an essential aspect of Terraform’s functionality. It is a JSON file that stores information about the resources that Terraform manages, as well as their current state and dependencies.
