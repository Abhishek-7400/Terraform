# Mostly use for configuration.
# File provisioning in Terraform refers to the process of copying files from your local machine or from a remote location to the provisioned infrastructure, such as EC2 instances. This can be useful for deploying configuration files, scripts, binaries, or any other files needed by your infrastructure
## There are several reasons why file provisioning may be necessary in Terraform
1. Configuration management
2. Application deployment
3. Customization
4. Automation
5. Integration with other tools

## Syntax
```
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "readme.md"          #From terraform
    destination = "/tmp/readme.md"     #Remote machine
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("${path.module}/id_rsa")   #private key id_rsa
      host        = self.public_ip                  #public ip_add of ec2 instance
    }
  }
```
## Additionally, you can use the connection block to specify connection settings for transferring files, such as SSH credentials
### Example
```
provider "aws" {
  region     = "ap-south-1"
  access_key = ""
  secret_key = ""

}

resource "aws_key_pair" "first_key" {
  key_name   = "terr-instacence-key"
  public_key = file("${path.module}/id_rsa.pub")
}

resource "aws_instance" "terraform_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-007020fd9c84e18c7"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = aws_key_pair.first_key.key_name
  tags = {
    Name = "ec2_terraform"
  }

  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "readme.md"          #From terraform
    destination = "/tmp/readme.md"     #Remote machine
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("${path.module}/id_rsa")   #private key id_rsa
      host        = self.public_ip                  #public ip_add of ec2 instance
    }
  }
}
```
