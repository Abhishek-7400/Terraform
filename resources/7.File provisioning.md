# Mostly use for configuration.
# File provisioning in Terraform refers to the process of copying files from your local machine or from a remote location to the provisioned infrastructure, such as EC2 instances. This can be useful for deploying configuration files, scripts, binaries, or any other files needed by your infrastructure
## There are several reasons why file provisioning may be necessary in Terraform
1. Configuration management
2. Application deployment
3. Customization
4. Automation
5. Integration with other tools

## Syntax
```
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "example-key"

  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "path/to/local/file"
    destination = "/path/on/remote/file"
  }
}
```
